/**
 * The two opposite meanings of "save" around an optimize run.
 *
 * An optimize result is staged, not committed (spec
 * `optimize-staging-05-panel`), so the word "save" points in two directions
 * inside the same panel:
 *
 * - **before** the run, {@link OPTIMIZE_DIRTY_GATE_HINT} is the gate: it asks
 *   about the *user's own canvas edits*, which the optimizer would otherwise
 *   overwrite. "Unsaved" now also covers a waiting optimize result, so the gate
 *   has to name whose edits it is asking about;
 * - **after** the run, {@link OPTIMIZE_SAVE_HINT} says the optimized
 *   coordinates are staged in the workspace and only land on Ctrl+S.
 *
 * {@link OPTIMIZE_SAVE_HINT} is duplicated verbatim on the stage side, which
 * sends the same literal as its persistent `info-text-change` line
 * (`stage/src/optimize/structure.ts`, `STAGED_HINT`) so every host — page,
 * VSCode, Python — shows one standing hint. The duplication is deliberate (the
 * page must not depend on stage internals for a string).
 *
 * Plain strings and one pure function: no React, no stage runtime.
 */

/**
 * Post-run: the result lives in the workspace until the user saves.

 * Pre-run gate: the user's own canvas edits, not a staged optimize result.
 *
 * Replaces the panel's older scene-wide save prompt, which became ambiguous
 * once an optimize run could itself be the thing that is unsaved. The retired
 * wording is deliberately not quoted here — the regression lock greps for it.
