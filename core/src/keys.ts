/**
 * Canonical molecular field names — the JavaScript mirror of
 * `molrs::store::keys` (Rust), which molpy also re-exports through
 * `molrs.fields`.
 *
 * molrs-wasm does not expose these constants to JS, so they are transcribed
 * here rather than each call site writing `"atomi"` inline for the fortieth
 * time. This module **defines nothing**: if a name here disagrees with
 * `molrs::store::keys`, this file is wrong.
 *
 * A drift gate lives in `python/tests/test_wire_parity.py`, which reads the
 * real `molrs.keys` and fails if these values fall out of step.
