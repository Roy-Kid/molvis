/**
 * Commands module — Command pattern for MolVis operations.
 *
 * All commands extend Command<T> with do()/undo(). The `@command(name)`
 * decorator on a class body registers the class into the global `commands`
 * registry as a *module-load side effect*.
 *
 * ⚠️  Tree-shaking trap (read before touching):
 * When `page/` bundles core from source via alias, the bundler treats every
 * source file as side-effect-free (core's package.json `sideEffects` glob
 * never matches `./src/**`). Bare `import "./foo"` side-effect imports get
 * dead-code-eliminated → `@command` decorator never runs → command vanishes
 * at runtime with `Unknown command: xxx`.
 *
 * The fix below is to name-import every decorated class and pin them all
 * into `REGISTERED_COMMAND_CLASSES`. `registerDefaultCommands()` then reads
 * that array — a live, observable use — which pulls each module into the
 * reachability graph and forces the bundler to evaluate it (running the
 * decorator along the way).
 *
 * Adding a new `@command(...)` class? Import it below AND add it to
 * `REGISTERED_COMMAND_CLASSES`. Do not rely on `import "./foo"` tricks.
