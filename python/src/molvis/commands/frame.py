        The streaming ingress. :meth:`set_trajectory` replaces the whole
        trajectory and forces a full pipeline rebuild plus a camera re-fit, so
        driving a running simulation through it costs O(N²) bytes and rebuilds
        the scene every step. This sends one frame, rebuilds nothing, and moves
        the camera only on the frame that creates the scene.

        Args:
            frame: A :class:`molpy.Frame`, ``Atomistic``, or molgraph — the same
                inputs :meth:`set_trajectory` accepts, one at a time.
            follow: Advance the viewer to the new frame (default). Pass
                ``False`` to leave the playhead wherever the user parked it
                while frames keep arriving.
            wait_for_response: Block until the browser acknowledges. Off by
                default — a producer at high rate should not pay a round trip
                per step. Turn it on when you need back-pressure, or when a
                dropped frame would be a bug rather than a skipped redraw.

        Returns:
            ``self``, for chaining.

        Note:
            Streamed frames are **not** kept in the reconnect mirror, unlike
            :meth:`set_trajectory`. Retaining them would hold the whole run in
            Python memory and re-serialize it on every page reload, and the
            frames are thread-bound (a relay decodes them off the main thread),
            so the mirror could not safely outlive the producer. A browser that
            reloads mid-stream therefore shows whatever the last
            ``set_trajectory`` / draw established until the next frame arrives
            — which, for a live stream, is the next step.
