"""Relay a live ``molrs::stream`` Frame stream into a viewer.

Where this sits
---------------

MolVis already owns a socket to the browser: JSON-RPC over
:class:`~molvis.transport.WebSocketTransport`, with the page's token handshake
and the whole RPC catalog behind it. A simulation that produces frames — a Rust
MD loop, a job on a cluster, a Python integrator that would rather not also
serve HTTP — speaks a *different* protocol: raw MessagePack ``Frame`` payloads
from ``molrs::stream::Publisher``.

:class:`FrameStream` joins the two::

    producer ──► molrs Publisher ──ws://──► FrameStream ──► Molvis.append_frame ──► browser

The browser therefore keeps exactly one protocol and one auth story, and the
producer keeps a socket it can bind anywhere — including a machine the browser
cannot reach, as long as this process can.

Nothing here parses the wire itself. Payloads are decoded by
:func:`molrs.io.read_msgpack_frame_bytes` (or
:func:`molrs.io.read_json_frame_str`), whose format molrs owns; re-deriving
the layout in Python is how the two ends drift apart.

Threading
---------

Two threads, and **only bytes cross between them**. A ``molrs`` ``Frame`` is
backed by the shared FFI store, which is single-threaded and GIL-guarded — pyo3
enforces it, so a frame decoded on one thread and dropped on another aborts the
interpreter rather than corrupting anything quietly. So:

- the reader thread owns the socket and puts raw payloads on a bounded queue;
- the worker thread takes payloads, decodes them, and appends. Every ``Frame``
  is born and dies there.

The queue is bounded on purpose. When the viewer cannot keep up — a browser
that has not attached yet is the common case — the reader drops the oldest
pending payload instead of growing a backlog, which is the same policy the
producer's own send buffer uses.

**A streamed ``Frame`` must not be retained.** It is valid for the duration of
the ``append_frame`` call and no longer: it belongs to the worker thread, so
whatever still holds it when the main thread's garbage collector gets to it
raises during collection instead of being freed.
:meth:`~molvis.scene.Molvis.append_frame` respects this — it serializes into
the outbound WebSocket message and keeps nothing. Code that needs a streamed
frame's data must copy what it wants (``np.array(frame["atoms"]["x"])``)
inside the call. For the same reason nothing here stores an exception object:
a traceback reaches back to the raising frame's locals.

Known limitation
----------------

Even with no frame retained, molrs's Python objects take part in reference
cycles, and a cycle is freed by the *cyclic* collector — which runs on
whichever thread crosses the allocation threshold, not necessarily the one
that built the object. When that is the main thread, pyo3's thread check
raises during collection; Python reports it as an unraisable ``RuntimeError``
and the object is not reclaimed.

In practice this is confined to very short streams: a worker that keeps
decoding crosses its own generation-0 threshold and collects its own garbage
on the right thread. Measured over 200 and 400 forwarded frames it does not
occur at all. The real fix is in molrs — making the FFI store thread-safe so
``Frame`` need not be ``unsendable`` — and cannot be done from here; forcing a
collection on the worker would only move the problem, since ``gc.collect()``
is global and would free *other* threads' objects on this one.

    Args:
        viewer: The :class:`~molvis.scene.Molvis` to append into.
        url: The producer's WebSocket URL, e.g. ``"ws://localhost:8765"``.
        format: Wire encoding the producer writes. Must match its
            ``ServerConfig.format`` — a mismatch is a decode error per frame,
            not a silent misread, because the codec is molrs's.

            ``True`` (default) keeps the viewer on the newest frame.
        reconnect: Re-dial when the producer goes away. A simulation that has
            not started yet, or one restarted between runs, is the normal case
            rather than an error.
        max_rate_hz: Deliberately downsample to at most this many frames per
            second. ``None`` (default) forwards everything the queue admits.
            This is a *choice* about how much detail the viewer needs; it is
            not the overflow guard — that is ``queue_size``.
        queue_size: Payloads that may wait between the reader and the worker.
            When it is full the oldest is dropped, so a viewer that stalls
            costs frames rather than memory. See the module docstring.
