"""Unit tests for :class:`molvis.FrameStream` — the molrs → viewer relay.

The end-to-end tests here run a real ``molrs.stream.Publisher`` in-process and
read it over a real loopback socket. That is a unit test of the relay, not an
e2e lane: no browser, no page bundle, no rendering — the viewer is a stub that
records what it was handed.

`molrs.stream` is a hard dependency now (molpy >= 0.13.0), so nothing here is
skipped for a stale install. :class:`TestMissingCodec` still runs, because the
codec can also go missing on a *newer* molrs that moved it, and the error a user
sees for that is worth pinning either way.
