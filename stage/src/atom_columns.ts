 * ({@link materializeFrameFromScene}, where canvas edits made the rows sparse or
 * longer) and the optimize round trip (`optimize/structure.ts`, where the worker
 * may have appended hydrogens). Both used to drop or privately re-implement it;
 * this module is what they share.

 * WASM. molrs's `Block` satisfies both as-is.

 * corrupt the frame's shared column data (`.claude/notes/molrs-handles.md`).

 * callers that own those columns overwrite them *after* `copyInto` returns.

 * through while still publishing its own coordinates.
