/**
 * A {@link DataSource} fed by a live producer over a WebSocket.
 *
 * The producer binds (`molrs::stream::Publisher`) and this dials it. That
 * orientation is deliberate: a run that takes hours outlives any one viewer, so
 * the long-lived end should be the one holding the port — a page reload
 * re-attaches instead of killing the stream, and more than one viewer can watch
 * the same run. The reverse (viewer binds, producer pushes) suits a short
 * script better, which is why {@link StreamMode} is a field rather than an
 * assumption; there is only one member today because there is only one
 * deployment shape asking for it.
 *
 * Frames are decoded by molrs, never here: `readFrameBytes` owns the wire
 * format, and re-deriving the layout in TypeScript is how the two ends drift
 * apart.
 *
 * ## Indices
 *
 * This is the one place a push source does not fit the pull interface
 * cleanly. `DataSource.getFrame(index)` is random access, but a stream only
 * ever grows at the tail and — under {@link StreamDataSourceOptions.maxFrames}
 * — shrinks at the head. So **an index is a position in the retained window,
 * not a step number**: once eviction starts, index 0 stops meaning "the first
 * frame the producer sent". `frameCount` is the retained count for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * The alternative — keeping absolute indices and throwing on an evicted one —
 * was rejected: the pipeline computes at whatever index the timeline holds, so
 * a throw there is a broken scene rather than a handled edge. Following the
 * tail, which is what a live view does, is unaffected either way.
