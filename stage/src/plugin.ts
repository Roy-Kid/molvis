/**
 * What a plugin may contribute to the 3D stage.

 * These are stage's own concepts, not shared contract: a `Modifier` receives
 * a `PipelineContext` carrying the renderer, so it cannot be engine-neutral.
 * Each engine exposes its own contribution surface; `@molcrafts/molvis-plugin`
 * re-exports this one so plugin authors still import a single package.
