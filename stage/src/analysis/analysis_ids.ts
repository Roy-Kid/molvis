/**
 * Catalog analysis ids — the one place `stage/` spells the string that names
 * an analysis.
 *
 * molrs is the Rust molecular core this package computes with, compiled to
 * WASM (WebAssembly, the binary format browsers execute at near-native speed).
 * It ships a *compute catalog*: a machine-readable list of every analysis that
 * build can actually run. Each catalog entry is an `AnalysisDefinition` (see
 * `./registry.ts`), and its `id` field is one of the strings below — goldens
 * copied from the `@molcrafts/molrs@^0.16.0` catalog, read 2026-10-08.
 * `stage/tests/analysis/analysis_ids.test.ts` fails if any of them stops
 * resolving to a catalog entry, which is how a stale constant — and the dead
 * dispatch branch behind it — gets caught.
 *
 * That id is the identity every consumer routes on: main-thread orchestration
 * (`./dispatch.ts`), the worker kernel (`./job_runner.ts`) and the pipeline
 * modifiers (`../pipeline/cluster_pipeline.ts`) import from here instead of
 * repeating the literal, and any UI that routes by analysis should do the same.
 *
 * This is the Wire layer of the analysis package: the tier both the browser
 * main thread and the analysis Web Worker are allowed to import. The full
 * layer table is in `./index.ts`.
 *
 * **Zero imports, deliberately.** That is the whole reason this module can be
 * referenced from a worker kernel, from main-thread orchestration and from a
 * pipeline modifier without coupling any of them to the others. Keep it that
 * way — no registry lookup, no molrs import, no helper.
