/**
 * Multi-frame analyses: the RDF (radial distribution function) and MSD (mean
 * squared displacement) entry points.
 *
 * Neither owns a frame loop. Both delegate the walk to the shared runners in
 * `./trajectory_runner`, which is the one place that expands a frame range,
 * follows the selected atoms from frame to frame, records per-frame failures,
 * beats progress and honours cancellation. {@link computeRdfTrajectory} runs a
 * single-frame kernel through {@link runTrajectoryFrames} and averages the
 * per-frame histograms afterwards; {@link computeMsdTrajectory} has no
 * per-frame result to average, so it streams frames into an accumulator
 * through {@link runTrajectoryAccumulate} and reads it once at the end. What is
 * left in this file is the parameter types, what one frame computes, and how
 * the frames combine.
 *
 * Both entry points take any {@link AnalysisTrajectorySource} — the structural
 * "how many frames, and the frame at an index" surface — rather than the
 * concrete stage `Trajectory`. That is what lets the same code run on the main
 * thread against the live trajectory and inside the compute worker against
 * frames rebuilt from plain snapshots (`./job_runner`), so the two paths are one
 * computation and not two implementations to keep in sync.
 *
 * Frame selection, atom tracking, progress and cancellation all come from
 * {@link AnalysisRunOptions} (`./trajectory_runner`). Lengths are in Å
 * throughout, volumes in Å³.

/**
 * Radial distribution function over a frame range.
 *
 * The RDF, written g(r), answers "how much more (or less) likely is it to find a
 * second atom at distance r from a given atom than if the atoms were spread
 * uniformly?" — a peak at r means a preferred separation, e.g. a first
 * coordination shell. One histogram is computed per frame with {@link computeRdf}
 * and the frames are then combined: g(r), the shell density and the presented
 * series are averaged, while raw pair counts are summed. See {@link
 * RdfParams.representation} for the p(r) / ρ(r) alternatives when the frame has
 * no cell to normalise against.
 *
 * The frames come from {@link runTrajectoryFrames} (`./trajectory_runner`), one
 * histogram per visit. Both atom groups are resolved once, on the reference
 * frame — {@link AnalysisRunOptions.referenceFrameIndex}, which defaults to the
 * first frame the range visits. Group A is the selection the runner itself
 * follows; group B is resolved here against that same frame and re-located
 * inside each visit, because the runner tracks one selection and a second
 * `selection` field on it would be the first field of an options bag. A group
 * that is a subset of the frame is followed across frames by the atoms' `id`
 * column when the frames carry a usable one (by row index otherwise, with a
 * warning on the tracked selection), so a reordered dump still histograms the
 * same atoms; a whole-frame group needs no tracking at all.
 *
 * A frame that fails on its own is recorded in `failures` and the run
 * continues. That includes every frame group B goes missing from, whatever
 * {@link AnalysisRunOptions.missingTrackedAtoms} says — the switch is the
 * runner's, so it governs group A alone. Cancellation is cooperative through
 * {@link AnalysisRunOptions.abortSignal} and lands at a frame boundary.
 *
 * @param trajectory any frame source — the live stage trajectory, or the
 *   worker's snapshot-backed source
 * @param params histogram settings and the two atom groups
 * @param run frame range, progress, per-frame error hook, abort signal

 *   range is empty or no frame had enough atoms to histogram
 * @throws AnalysisAbortError when the run was cancelled
 * @throws Error re-raising the first per-frame failure when *every* frame failed
 *   — a real cause (bad cutoff, missing cell, missing tracked atoms) beats a

 * Mean squared displacement over a frame range.

 * in the origin frame, the MSD at a frame is the average of |r(t) − r(0)|² over
 * the tracked atoms, in Å²: how far, squared, atoms have wandered from where
 * they started. It grows roughly linearly with time for a diffusing liquid
 * and plateaus for atoms trapped in a solid, which is why it is the usual first
 * look at mobility.
 *
 * {@link runTrajectoryAccumulate} (`./trajectory_runner`) streams the range into
 * an {@link MsdAnalyzer} one frame at a time — no JavaScript array of frames is
 * ever held — and this function reads the analyzer once at the end and disposes
 * it, since the handle is its own.
 *
 * The **first frame actually fed is the origin**: displacements are measured
 * from it, so its own MSD is ~0, and it is `frameIndices[0]` of the result
 * rather than of the requested range — if the first planned frame fails, the
 * next one that feeds becomes the origin. That is a different frame from
 * {@link AnalysisRunOptions.referenceFrameIndex}, which only says where the
 * tracked selection is resolved. A subset selection is followed by the atoms'
 * `id` column when the frames carry a usable one (by row index otherwise), so
 * the same atoms are compared even if rows move between frames.
