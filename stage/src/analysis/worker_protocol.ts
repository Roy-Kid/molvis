 * run would — reads each frame from the trajectory, and snapshots it. Every

 * `id` column must be) lives in the single-frame function alone; nothing is
 * re-decided here. Frames are read one at a time rather than all at once, so a
 * trajectory that still has to decode or fetch a frame is asked for one frame
 * at a time, as the main-thread walk asks.
 *
 * **The frames belong to the trajectory.** They are read and copied, never
 * freed: molrs frames are handles into WebAssembly memory, and freeing one the

 * is a problem — and what to tell the user about it — belongs to the caller

 * needs two), so an empty trajectory, an empty range, or a range that starts
 * past its end all answer `[]` quietly.

 *   {@link AnalysisTrajectorySource}, so the live stage trajectory and a
 *   worker-side source both serve. It keeps owning every frame it hands out.
 * @param frameRange frames to pack, in visit order. Defaults to the whole
 *   trajectory, stride 1; out-of-range bounds are clamped, not rejected.

 *   stays addressable instead of being renumbered `0 … n-1`
 * @throws Error from {@link snapshotFrameForAnalysis} for the first frame that

 *   the trajectory, so the whole job fails rather than silently shipping a
