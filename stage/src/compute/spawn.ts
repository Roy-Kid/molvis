/**
 * Spawn the colocated compute worker.
 *
 * The URL pattern is the rsbuild / rspack-supported
 * `new Worker(new URL(..., import.meta.url))` form, so any host that bundles
 * this package (page rsbuild, python-served dist) folds `worker.js` into its
 * own build as a worker chunk — same pattern as
 * `transport/trajectory_worker/runtime.ts`.
 *
 * The reference is `./worker.js`, not `./worker.ts`: rslib builds this
 * package bundleless, transpiling `worker.ts` → `worker.js` while leaving the
 * URL string verbatim, so the published dist resolves to the emitted file.
 *
 * Hosts that build the worker separately (VS Code webview) swap this module
 * via `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` — keep it single-purpose.

  // `workerChunkLoading: "import"` (rslib is already ESM), and the repo
  // `.browserslistrc` keeps the browser floor module-worker-capable.
  // Under legacy `importScripts` loading a module worker dies at boot.
