# Python and Jupyter

The Python binding controls the same browser frontend over a local,
token-authenticated WebSocket. One `molvis.Molvis` class adapts its display to
the host:

- a normal Python process opens a browser tab;
- JupyterLab, classic Jupyter, Colab, and VS Code notebooks mount inline output;
- a headless process can host the command channel without opening a display.
