# VS Code troubleshooting

## The editor is blank

Open **MolVis: Show Output Channel** and VS Code's **Developer: Toggle Developer
Tools**. A blank canvas is usually one of three classes:

- WebGL/GPU initialization failed;
- a webview script or WASM asset failed to load;
- the file loader rejected the selected format/content.

On Linux, verify hardware acceleration is enabled and restart VS Code after
changing GPU flags.

## The file opens as text

Use **Open With… → MolVis Quick View**. If the format should always use MolVis,
choose **Configure default editor for…**. Text formats intentionally have
`option` priority so installing MolVis does not unexpectedly replace the user's
editor choice; binary DCD/TRR/XTC use MolVis by default.

## Save is disabled or fails

Confirm that:

- the active tab is a MolVis custom editor or Quick View;
- the source format has a writer;
- the workspace provider is writable;
- the resource is a file rather than a Zarr directory;
- the Output channel does not report a serialization error.

## A large file never appears

Check transfer and memory messages in the Output channel.

- **Structure files** (LAMMPS data, POSCAR, …) open as one frame. MolVis does
  not refuse them for size. A VS Code `TextDocument` path is still capped at
  ~50 MB — use Quick View / Stage, not the text editor.
- **Streamable trajectories** open by range (`openUri` / `readRange`). A
  512 MiB dump is no longer refused on a `file:` URI.
- **Eager-only** trajectories at or above 512 MiB are still refused — there
  is no range indexer for those formats.
- The standalone web app streams a local `File` handle the same way.

Press Esc on the web app while “Indexing …” is showing to cancel the scan.

## Notebook selection is different

The VS Code extension and a Python/Jupyter `Molvis` scene are separate sessions
unless explicitly connected through the backend workflow. A selection in one
is not automatically mirrored into the other.
