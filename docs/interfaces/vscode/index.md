# VS Code

The MolVis extension integrates molecular files with VS Code's editor,
workspace, remote-file, command, and settings APIs. It is not a separate
renderer: its webviews host the same stage engine as the web product, with a
VS Code–specific host protocol for files and settings.

## Choose a surface

| Surface | Use it when |
|---|---|
| Quick View (Stage) | One file is the document of record; light 3D peek |
| Workbench | Session with **Stage + Sketch** tabs, outline, multi-load |
| Open Stage / Open Sketch | Jump into Workbench on that engine |
| Open Page | Full React product shell |
| Activity Bar Home | Recent files and workflow entry (native tree) |
| Activity Bar Sketch | Standalone 2D sketch webview |
