# API Reference

Welcome to the dictionary.

## What is this section?

This is the raw, unadulterated specification of our classes and functions. If you need to know exactly what arguments `draw_frame` accepts or what the return type of `get_scene` is, you are in the right spot.

## Why read this?

Because sometimes you don't want a story, you just want the facts.

## How is it organized?

*   **[Python SDK](python.md):** The `molvis` package documentation.
*   **[Core Library](core.md):** The `@molvis/core` package documentation.
