# Welcome to Molvis

Hey there! Welcome to the official documentation for **Molvis**, the molecular visualization toolkit that actually makes sense.

Molvis is a shiny, modern library for looking at molecules. Whether you're a data scientist crunching numbers in a Jupyter notebook or a web developer building the next big drug discovery platform, Molvis is here to help you render atoms and bonds without pulling your hair out. It's built on top of Babylon.js, so it's fast, it's 3D, and it looks great right out of the box. We have a Python package for your analysis workflows and a TypeScript core if you want to get your hands dirty building custom web applications.

Let's be honest, existing visualization tools can be a bit clunky. You often have to choose between a heavy desktop application or a web viewer that's hard to integrate. We wanted something that felt lightweight but powerful. We wanted a tool that treats "visualization" as a component you can just plug in, not a monolithic beast you have to wrestle with. We designed Molvis to be modular, fast, and developer-friendly.

Getting started depends on where you're coming from. If you are a **Python user**, just `pip install molvis` and you are good to go. If you are a **Web Developer**, grab the core package from npm via `npm install @molvis/core`. Once you're installed, head over to the **Tutorials** section to draw your first molecule. Trust us, it's easier than you think.
