# User Guide

This is the meat and potatoes. The tutorials got you a "Hello World", but now you want to actually build something useful.

## What is this section?

The User Guide is a collection of deep dives into specific concepts. We break down the machinery of Molvis into digestible parts. If you are wondering "How do I control the camera?" or "What exactly *is* a Frame?", this is where you look.

## Why read this?

Because blindly copying code snippets only gets you so far. Understanding the *concepts* allows you to bend the tool to your will. We explain the design philosophy behind our decisions so you can work *with* the framework, not against it.

## How is it organized?

*   **[Scene Management](scene.md):** Everything about the `Molvis` instance, resizing, and lifecycle.
*   **[Data & Drawing](data.md):** How we handle molecular data, frames, and the rendering pipeline.
*   **[Interaction](interaction.md):** Selecting atoms, moving the camera, and handling user input.
