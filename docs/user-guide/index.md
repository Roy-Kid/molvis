# User Guide

This is the meat and potatoes of the documentation. While the tutorials got you a "Hello World", this section is where you learn to actually build something useful. We break down the machinery of Molvis into digestible parts, answering questions like "How do I control the camera?" or "What exactly *is* a Frame?".

Blindly copying code snippets only gets you so far. Understanding the *concepts* allows you to bend the tool to your will. We explain the design philosophy behind our decisions so you can work *with* the framework, not against it.

*   **[Scene Management](scene.md):** Everything about the `Molvis` instance, resizing, and lifecycle.
*   **[Data & Drawing](data.md):** How we handle molecular data, frames, and the rendering pipeline.
*   **[Interaction](interaction.md):** Selecting atoms, moving the camera, and handling user input.
