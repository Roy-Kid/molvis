# Tutorials

Welcome to the classroom! This is where we get your hands dirty with some actual code. Don't worry, we'll keep it light.

These tutorials are designed to take you from "I installed it, now what?" to "Look at this rotating protein!" in about five minutes. We have two main tracks depending on your tech stack. We structured it this way because reading API references is boring and you probably just want to see something cool appear on your screen. These guides are practical, copy-paste-friendly, and guarantee a quick win.

*   **Go to [Python (Jupyter)](python.md)** if you live in Jupyter Notebooks or Lab and want to visualize data from `molpy`.
*   **Go to [Web (Core)](core.md)** if you are building a React/Vue/Vanilla JS app and want to embed a 3D viewer.
