 * Host modules every page plugin must externalize at build time.
 *
 * The host loader injects the same bare specifiers. Both directions fail:
 * - externalized but not injected → bare specifier fails at runtime
 * - injected but not externalized → second copy of react/molrs/WASM
 *
 * The host's inject map is checked against this list at compile time
 * (`page/src/plugins/host_shared.ts`), so drift is a type error, not a
 * runtime surprise.
 *
 * Import via `@molcrafts/molvis/plugin` (or `@molcrafts/molvis-plugin`).
